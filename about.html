            Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share
            insightful perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the
            world—without building a mailing list or a following first. The
            internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight.
            It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right
            audience for whatever you have to say. We believe that what you read
            and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or
            discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and
            surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system that
            rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful
            conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging.

            Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium
            every month. Many are professional writers, but just as many
            aren’t — they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents, amateur
            novelists, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into
            the world. They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping
            them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve
            learned that the rest of us might want to know too. Instead of
            selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing
            community of Medium members who align with our mission. If you’re
            new here, start exploring. Dive deeper into whatever matters to you.
            Find a post that helps you learn something new, or reconsider
            something familiar—and then share your own story.
