            In communications and information processing, code is a system of
            rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image,
            or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
            communication through a communication channel or storage in a
            storage medium. An early example is the invention of language, which
            enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought,
            saw, heard or felt to others. But speech limits the range of
            communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the
            audience to those present when the speech is uttered . The invention
            of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols,
            extended the range of communication across space and time. The
            process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols
            for communication or storage. Decoding is the reverse process,
            converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient
            understands, such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for coding
            is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language,
            spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example,
            semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or
            the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message,
            typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a
            great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words
            sent. In communications and information processing, code is a system
